# Oyster Card Data

A simple (ongoing) project to visualize Oyster Card data based on the CSV files sent out every month by Transport for London. This is mainly a tool so I can keep track of how long my commute is on average but also a chance to use `grunt`, `SASS`, testing, or whatever else I'd like to explore a bit more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/kevinmarsh/OysterData.git`
2. `cd OysterData`
3. Run `npm install` to grab all the requirements from `package.json`
4. Run `grunt` to build the css/js/img files
5. Open `build/index.html` in your browser
